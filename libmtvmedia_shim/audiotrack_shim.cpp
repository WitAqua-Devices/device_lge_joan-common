 * An android 9 shaped AudioTrack.
 *
 * MobitPlayerService::AudioOutput drives one AudioTrack, and it was compiled
 * when the class still read
 *
 *     class AudioTrack : public RefBase
 *
 * Since then RefBase became a *virtual* base - the MemoryHeapBase break of
 * memoryheap_shim.cpp, running the other way - and the object grew from 840
 * (0x348) to 1008 (0x3f0) bytes. Three things follow, and the blob has all
 * three burned in:
 *
 *   allocation   `mov.w r0,#0x348; bl operator new` at 0x4a2e0 and 0x4a362,
 *                168 bytes short of the current sizeof.
 *
 *   upcast       sp<AudioTrack>::operator= is a weak definition inside the blob
 *                (0x47878) and hands the raw pointer to RefBase::incStrong with
 *                no adjustment at all, because in android 9 there was none to
 *                make. Today RefBase sits at +1000, so that reads mAudioTrack
 *                as if it were mRefs. Unlike MemoryHeapBase there is no
 *                `ldr rN,[vptr,#-16]` to repoint - the code was never emitted.
 *
 *   fields       four of AudioTrack's inline accessors are expanded into the
 *                blob at the android 9 offsets:
 *                  +0x48  frameCount()   (bufferSize, frameCount, open)
 *                  +0x64  channelCount() (channelCount, open)
 *                  +0x1bc frameSize()    (frameSize)
 *                  +0x1c0 initCheck()    (open, decides whether the track took)
 *                All four moved: +0x4c, +0x78, +0x1d8, +0x1dc.
 *
 * Constructing a current AudioTrack in the blob's storage - which is what this
 * file used to do - loses on every one of those. So this is the memoryheap_shim
 * treatment instead: a class laid out the way the blob remembers, holding a
 * real AudioTrack behind a pointer, with extract-files.py renaming the
 * fourteen symbols the blob looks up - the constructor and thirteen methods,
 * all of which resolve to libaudioclient today:
 *
 *     android10AudioTrack  ->  android10LegacyTrak
 *
 * Same length, so it is a byte-for-byte edit of .dynstr entries and nothing
 * moves. The pattern carries the `android` prefix on purpose: `10AudioTrack`
 * alone would also hit the blob's own two weak sp<AudioTrack>::operator=
 * *definitions*, and those are indexed by .gnu.hash - renaming a defined symbol
 * without rebuilding the hash makes it unfindable, and since the blob's
 * reference to it is weak the linker would quietly bind it to address 0.
 * Leaving them alone is also what we want: nothing else in the process defines
 * either name, so they keep resolving to the blob's own copies, and those hand
 * the raw pointer to incStrong with no adjustment - which is correct here,
 * because RefBase is back at offset 0.
 *
 * The blob never dispatches virtually on the track (its vtable is not in the
 * blob and there are no vcalls through it), so only the four mirrored fields
 * and the total size are load bearing. Both are checked below.
