    # constant went with their libstagefright_foundation. libmtvmedia_shim/ has
    # both, under its own name rather than claiming the framework's.
    #
    # The second fixup is the CAS path. android::MemoryHeapBase lost a virtual
    # base since android 9, so its vtable carries one metadata word less and the
    # upcasts this was built with - inlined, with the displacement baked in -
    # read the wrong words:
    #
    #              android 9                          current
    #   vptr-16    vbase offset, RefBase   (0x30)      (before the vtable)
    #   vptr-12    vbase offset, IMemoryHeap (0x20)    vbase offset, RefBase
    #
    # so the first CAS callback takes lgemtvserver down with SIGSEGV. The class
    # layout is not something a shim can paper over, but the blob only ever
    # looks up the constructor by name - the rest goes through the vtable of
    # whatever that constructor built - so pointing it at a MemoryHeapBase that
    # still has the virtual base makes all of it line up again. That class is
    # android::LegacyHeapBase in libmtvmedia_shim/memoryheap_shim.cpp, and this
    # rewrites the one undefined symbol that reaches it. Same length, so it is a
    # byte-for-byte edit of a single .dynstr entry, and .gnu.hash does not index
    # undefined symbols, so no hash bucket has to follow it.
    # The playback path has the same shape of problem twice over, and the same
    # answer: what the blob looks up by name is one constructor, everything
    # after it goes through a vtable, so the constructor decides the layout.
    #
    #   MediaPlayerBase gained setDataSource(const String8&) at slot 13, so the
    #   android 9 slot numbers this drives NuPlayerDriver with are all one
    #   short from setVideoSurfaceTexture on - prepareAsync calls prepare,
    #   start calls prepareAsync, and setAudioSink calls releaseDrm, which is
    #   why the blob's audio output never reached the player.
    #
    #   Its AudioSink is on the other side of the same break: the framework
    #   calls the blob's object, and setPlayerIId() was inserted after open().
    #   That one is bridged inside the shim rather than renamed, because the
    #   vtable being called is the blob's own.
    #
    # libmtvmedia_shim/nuplayer_shim.cpp has both, built against vtables
    # decoded out of the stock libmediaplayerservice.so rather than guessed.
